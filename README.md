## Introduction

The goal of {hagis} is to provide analysis tools for plant pathogens
with gene-for-gene interactions in the R programming language that the
original [Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet,
HaGiS](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x), (Herrmann,
Löwer and Schachtel) provided.

This R package has been published in *MPMI* as a resource announcement
[(McCoy *et al.* 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0180-A). You
may wish to refer to that paper for further information on this package.

## Overview

{hagis} was initially created for *Phytophthora sojae* surveys by
Dr. Austin McCoy and Dr. Zachary Noel at Michigan State University in
the US, where the disease has been managed primarily via deployment of
resistance genes (*Rps* genes, resistance to *P. sojae*) in commercial
soybean cultivars and by the application of fungicide seed treatments.
However, repeated use of resistance genes can cause populations to adapt
over time rendering these resistance genes ineffective. To determine
current effectiveness of resistance genes for managing *P. sojae*,
state-wide surveys (in the US) are conducted to determine the pathotype
(previously referred to as “race”) structure within sampled population
of *P. sojae*.

However, the package is not only useful for *P. sojae* work. It was
built to be useful for other plant pathogen gene-for-gene interaction
systems, *e.g.*, wheat rusts, but it has been used in animal science as
well, see [Cain *et al.*
2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-022-05533-y).

The goal of this package is to provide all the necessary analyses needed
when conducting a pathotype surveys, including: distribution of
susceptibilities (effective and non-effective resistance genes),
distribution of pathotype complexities with statistics, pathotype
frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes in
an efficient and reproducible manner.

detailed information on how to use {hagis} along with working examples
using a built-in data set.

## Quick Start Install

### Stable Version

A CRAN version of {hagis} is available but lags behind the GitHub
version. They both will give exactly the same results.

``` r
install.packages("hagis")
```

### Development Version

A development version is available from from GitHub that may provide bug
fixes or new features not yet available from CRAN.

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library("remotes")
}

install_github("openplantpathology/hagis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
