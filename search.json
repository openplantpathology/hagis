However, repeated use resistance genes can cause populations adapt time rendering resistance genes ineffective. determine current effectiveness resistance genes managing P. sojae, state-wide surveys (US) conducted determine pathotype (previously referred “race”) structure within sampled population P. sojae. However, package useful P. sojae work. built useful plant pathogen gene--gene interaction systems, e.g., wheat rusts, used animal science well, see Cain et al. 2022. goal package provide necessary analyses needed conducting pathotype surveys, including: distribution susceptibilities (effective non-effective resistance genes), distribution pathotype complexities statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, well diversity indices pathotypes efficient reproducible manner.
